# PDHCG-II

PDHCG-II is a high-performance, GPU-accelerated implementation of the Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient (PDHG) algorithm designed for solving large-scale Convex Quadratic Programming (QP) problems.

## Problem Formulation

PDHCG solves convex quadratic programs in the following form:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\min_{x} \quad & \frac{1}{2}x^\top (Q + R^\top R) x + c^\top x \\
\text{s.t.} \quad & \ell_c \le Ax \le u_c, \\
                  & \ell_v \le x \le u_v.
\end{aligned}
$$

Where:

- $Q$ is a sparse positive semi-definite matrix (optional)
- $R$ is a low-rank matrix such that $R^\top R$ represents a low-rank component (optional)
- $A$ is the constraint matrix
- $c$ is the linear objective vector
- $\ell_c, u_c$ are constraint bounds
- $\ell_v, u_v$ are variable bounds

## Key Features

- **GPU Acceleration**: Fully leverages NVIDIA CUDA for extreme-scale QP problems
- **Flexible Problem Structure**: Supports sparse quadratic terms, low-rank quadratic terms, or both
- **Robust Algorithm**: Enhanced PDHCG algorithm with restart mechanisms and preconditioning
- **Multiple Interfaces**: C++ executable, C API, and Python bindings
- **High Performance**: Competitive with commercial solvers on large-scale problems
